## 📌 Overview

The **Disease Detector** is a machine learning project designed to predict diseases based on patient health data.
By leveraging classification algorithms, the model analyzes symptoms and medical attributes to generate predictions that can support healthcare diagnostics.

This project is implemented in **Python** using **Jupyter Notebook**, with machine learning libraries for training, evaluation, and deployment.

---

## 🚀 Features

* **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning** – Handles missing values, normalization, and dataset preparation.
* **Machine Learning Models** – Trains models (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression) for disease prediction.
* **Model Evaluation** – Uses accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification metrics.
* **Model Persistence** – Saves trained models with Joblib for reuse.
* **Interactive Notebook** – Step-by-step experimentation via Jupyter Notebook.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python 3.x**
* **NumPy, Pandas** → Data handling & preprocessing
* **Scikit-learn** → ML algorithms & evaluation
* **Matplotlib, Seaborn** → Data visualization
* **Joblib** → Model persistence

## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Disease_Detector.git
   cd Disease_Detector
   ```
---

## ▶️ Usage

1. Open the Jupyter/Colab Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Disease_Detector.ipynb
   ```

2. Run the notebook step by step to:

   * Load & preprocess data
   * Train ML models
   * Evaluate performance
   * Save the trained model

3. (Optional) Use the saved **`.pkl`** model for deployment in other applications.

---

## 📊 Example Workflow

1. Load dataset
2. Preprocess data (cleaning, normalization, feature selection)
3. Train ML model (Random Forest / Logistic Regression / etc.)
4. Evaluate performance (accuracy, confusion matrix)
5. Save model for later use

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Develop a **Streamlit Web App** for a user-friendly interface
* Expand dataset to cover **more disease categories**
* Integrate **Deep Learning models** for improved accuracy
* Deploy on **Cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Heroku)** for scalability
